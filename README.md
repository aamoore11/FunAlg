# Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort

 Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.



Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.



Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It is considered an ” in-place ” sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn’t require any additional memory space beyond the original array.


# Dijkstra's Algorithm 

The need for Dijkstra’s algorithm arises in many applications where finding the shortest path between two points is crucial.

For example, It can be used in the routing protocols for computer networks and also used by map systems to find the shortest path between starting point and the destination.

Dijkstra's algorithm is also utilized in video game development and robotics for pathfinding purposes. It enables game characters or robots to navigate through a complex environment, avoiding obstacles and finding the shortest path to reach their targets.
